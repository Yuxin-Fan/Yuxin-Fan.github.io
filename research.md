## [Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling]
ICM is a competition held by [COMAP], ( the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications), our team participated the competition in 2015 and I am the team leader, we write a paper about ‘Social Network’ and received *Honorable Mention*. In the paper we started with defining the initial value of messages by information entropy and PageRank algorithm, then we simulated how the messages value changed in the whole process by real Facebook data.
