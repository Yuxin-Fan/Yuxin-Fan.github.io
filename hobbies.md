## Hobbies

### Cooking
　　I started learning cooking when I was 6. I enjoy cooking.  I am good at doing traditional Chinese food and I can also do some traditional Korean food. Receiving too many great comments from my friends. 

### Travelling
　　The Cities I have visited till Jan 2021 are marked on the map. Only including cities in China.
