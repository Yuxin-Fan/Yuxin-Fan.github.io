## Cooking
I started learning cooking when I was in Sweden. I enjoyed cooking and good at doing traditional Chinese food. Recieving too many great comment from my friends. 


## Football
I am at fullback in my College *Team-SAM*, I like playing football with my friends. when I was under pressure, I prefer to playing football.


## Past Hobbies
I previously enjoyed table tennis and basketball, learned play the violin from 6 to 16 years old. However, I almost forget how to play it, I hope I can learn it when I am free.
