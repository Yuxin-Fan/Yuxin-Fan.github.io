### Hi, this is my personal page. I would like to introduce myself here.[^1]
-----------------------------------------


I am a penultimate year student in the B.Ec program of [School of Statistics and Mathematics]() in the [Central University of Finance and Economics (China)](). My GPA after 5 semesters is 3.6/4.0.

I am a R user and python learner, also a fan of R. I enjoy the moment of using R.

I like Statistics and Mathematics (although I am not very good at it) and interested in Maco-economics.

**In statistics fields**, I have done many projects involve,
 
 + Ridge Regression | [Report](); [Code]()
 + Linear Regression | [Pdf](); [Code]()
 + SVM, Classfication | [Pdf](); [Code]()  
 + Machine Learning | [Code]()


The book *Machine Learning whith R* and *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* give me too much spark.

**In economics fields**, 
 
 + Time Series analysis | [Report](); [Code]()
 + Literature Review about *The impact of the government on the economy* | [Report]()
 + Effect of inquiry range on underpricing | [Report]()

*Principles of Economics (Mankiw)* lead me to a new world, *Time Series Analysis with applications in R* and *Applied Economatrics (Wooldridge)* teach me how to do reasearch in economics fields.

I would like to go on to study in ecnomics field, prepare to apply phd in statistics or ecnomics (better) later this year. Thus, I am looking for an internship or RA in a economics or statistics group.

I wish that my efforts and new ideas could be quite helpful to what the project/research topic demands.

Here is my [CV]() and [Cover Letter]()
