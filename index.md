# About me

<img src="/images/Jiafeng2.JPG" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Jiafeng Liu.  I am a penultimate year student in the B.Ec program, major in Economics Statistics, of [School of Statistics and Mathematics] in the [Central University of Finance and Economics (China)].

I am a big fan of R and also a python user. I enjoy the moment of using R.  

I like Statistics and Mathematics and interested in Maco-economics and Econometrics.

**In statistics fields**, I have done many projects involve,

- Ridge Regression | [Report]; [Code]
- Linear Regression | [Pdf]; [Code]
- SVM, Classfication | [Pdf]; [Code] 
- Machine Learning | [Code]

**In economics fields**, 
 
- Time Series analysis | [Report]; [Code]
- Literature Review about *The impact of the government on the economy* | [Report]
- Effect of inquiry range on underpricing | [Report]

*Principles of Economics (Mankiw)* lead me to a new world, *Time Series Analysis with applications in R* and *Applied Economatrics (Wooldridge)* teach me how to do reasearch in economics fields.

I would like to go on to study in ecnomics field, prepare to apply phd in statistics or ecnomics (better) later this year. Thus, I am looking for an internship or RA in a economics or statistics group.

I wish that my efforts and new ideas could be quite helpful to what the project/research topic demands.

Here is my [CV] and [Cover Letter]
