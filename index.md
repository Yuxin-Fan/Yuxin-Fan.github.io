<img src="/images/Jiafeng2.JPG" class="floatpic" width="220" height="200">
My name is Jiafeng Liu.  I am a last year student in the B.Sc program, major in Economics Statistics, of [School of Statistics and Mathematics] in the [Central University of Finance and Economics (China)].  I am also a remote research assistant in Department of Economics Harvard University, researcher in Economics and Management Lab and charge of CATI Lab ([click for detail about my research experience]). I am a big fan of R and also a python user, ever did several projects by using R and python to model and analyse. I like Statistics and Mathematics and interested in Maco-economics and Econometrics. I would like to go on studying in statistical field, specifically in ‘statistic learning’ or ‘computational statistics’, prepare to apply Ph.D. in statistics later this year. 

**In statistics fields**, I have done many projects involve,

  - Ridge Regression; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-14-Ridge-Regression.html); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-14-Ridge-Regression.html)
  - Linear Regression; [Pdf](https://github.com/JayfongL); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-LinearModel.R)
  - Best Subset Regression; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-10-Best-subset-selection.html); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-10-Best-subset-selection.html)
  - Time Series analysis; [Report](https://github.com/JayfongL); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-TimeSeries.R)
  - SVM, Classfication; [Pdf](http://Jiafengliu.me); [Code](https://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-SVMcar_classification.R)
  - Decision Tree and Random Forest; [Code](https://github.com/JayfongL)
  - MCMC; [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-MCMC.R)
  - Newton Iteration; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2015-04-01-Newton-Iteration.html)[Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-Newton.R)
  
**In economics and econometrics fields**, 
 
  - Time Series analysis; [Report](https://Jiafengliu.me); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me)
  - Literature Review: *The impact of the government on the economy*; [Chinese Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/research)
  - *Effect of inquiry range on underpricing based on Shanghai A Share*; [Chinese Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/research)


I wish that my efforts and new ideas could be quite helpful to what the project or research topic demands.
