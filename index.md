# About Me

<img src="/images/Jiafeng2.JPG" class="floatpic" width="220" height="200">
My name is Jiafeng Liu.  I am a final year student in the B.Sc program, majoring in Economics Statistics, of [School of Statistics and Mathematics] in the [Central University of Finance and Economics (CUFE, China)].  I am also a remote research assistant in Department of Economics Harvard University, researcher in Economics and Management Lab CUFE and the charge of CATI Lab ([click for detail about my research experience]). I am a big fan of R and also a python user. I have done several projects by using R and python to do modeling and data analysis. I like Statistics and Mathematics and I am also interested in Econometrics. I would like to go on studying in statistics, specifically in ‘statistical learning’, ‘kernel methods’ or ‘computational statistics’, preparing to apply for Ph.D. later this year. 

**In statistics fields**, I have done many projects involving,

  - Linear Regression; [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-LinearModel.txt)
  - Ridge, Lasso, LARS Regression; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-14-Ridge-Regression.html); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-14-Ridge-Regression.html)
  - Best Subset Regression; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-10-Best-subset-selection.html); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2016-03-10-Best-subset-selection.html)
  - SVM, Classfication; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/paperRequest.txt); [Code](https://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-SVMcar_classification.txt)
  - Principal component analysis
  - Clustering
  - Time Series analysis; [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-TimeSeries.txt)
  - Decision Tree and Random Forest; [Code](https://github.com/JayfongL/Cython-Python)
  - MCMC; [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-MCMC.txt)
  - Newton Iteration; [Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/blogs/2015-04-01-Newton-Iteration.html); [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-Newton.txt)
  
**In economics and econometrics fields**, 
 
  - Time Series analysis; [Code](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/2015-TimeSeries.txt)
  - Literature Review: *The impact of the government on the economy*; [Chinese Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/paperRequest.txt)
  - *Effect of inquiry range on underpricing based on Shanghai A Share*; [Chinese Report](http://Jiafengliu.me/research/paperRequest.txt)


I wish that my efforts and ideas could be prepare me well for future research projects.
